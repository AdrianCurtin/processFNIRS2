function out = dedupeMarkers(data, varargin)
% DEDUPEMARKERS Collapse near-duplicate markers firing within a tolerance
%
% Removes near-duplicate event markers, where "near-duplicate" means a row
% that shares the same marker Code as, and falls within a small time tolerance
% of, an earlier KEPT row (the cluster anchor). Such duplicates typically come
% from bouncing trigger lines, repeated serial sends, or a stimulus that
% re-fires the same code in quick succession.
%
% The dedup is anchor-based, not run-collapsing: per Code, the earliest row
% becomes the anchor and any later same-code row within Tolerance of THAT
% anchor is dropped. When a row falls outside the window it is kept and
% becomes the new anchor. So, at Tolerance = 0.05 s, onsets at 0, 0.04, 0.08
% keep BOTH 0 and 0.08 (0.08 is > 0.05 past the 0 anchor) and drop only 0.04 -
% it does NOT collapse the whole run to a single row.
%
% Reference:
%   Internal pf2 implementation.
%
% Syntax:
%   data    = pf2.data.dedupeMarkers(data)
%   data    = pf2.data.dedupeMarkers(data, 'Tolerance', tol)
%   markers = pf2.data.dedupeMarkers(markerTable, ...)
%   ...     = pf2.data.dedupeMarkers(..., 'Name', Value)
%
% Inputs:
%   data - fNIRS data struct with a .markers table, or a marker table/matrix
%          directly. A struct returns a struct (with .markers deduped); a
%          table/matrix returns a deduped canonical table.
%
% Name-Value Parameters:
%   'Tolerance' - Time window in seconds within which two same-code markers
%                 are treated as duplicates (default: 0.05). Markers of the
%                 same Code whose Time falls within this gap of the kept
%                 (earliest) row of the cluster are removed. Larger values
%                 collapse more aggressively.
%   'Verbose'   - Print the number of markers removed (default: true).
%
% Outputs:
%   out - Same form as input (struct or table) with near-duplicate marker
%         rows removed. Surviving rows are returned sorted by ascending Time
%         (chronological), regardless of input order; extra columns are kept.
%
% Algorithm:
%   1. Normalize markers to the canonical table (Time, Code, Duration,
%      Amplitude + extras) so matrix/table inputs both work.
%   2. Sort rows by Time (stable) and walk them per Code, anchoring each
%      cluster on its earliest row.
%   3. Drop any same-code row whose Time is within Tolerance of the cluster
%      anchor (the window is measured from the anchor, so a run is NOT fully
%      collapsed); a row outside the window is kept and becomes the new anchor.
%   4. Return the surviving rows sorted by ascending Time.
%
% Example:
%   % Collapse trigger bounce within 50 ms on the sample data
%   data = pf2.import.sampleData();
%   data = pf2.data.dedupeMarkers(data);
%
%   % Operate on a marker table directly, wider tolerance, quietly
%   m = pf2_base.normalizeMarkers([10 49; 10.02 49; 30 49]);
%   m = pf2.data.dedupeMarkers(m, 'Tolerance', 0.1, 'Verbose', false);
%
% Notes:
%   - Duplicate detection is per Code: same-time markers with DIFFERENT
%     codes are never collapsed.
%   - 'Tolerance' = 0 disables deduplication (nothing is removed).
%   - The window is measured from each cluster's anchor (earliest kept row),
%     so a long run of closely-spaced repeats is thinned, not collapsed to
%     a single row.
%   - Survivors are returned sorted by ascending Time even if the input was
%     unsorted; extra/user marker columns ride along with their rows.
